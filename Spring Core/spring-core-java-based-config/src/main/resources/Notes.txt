The Project Details

Add these to get Spring Core features (@Configuration, @Bean, ApplicationContext):
    - Spring Core Maven Dependency
    - Spring Context Maven Dependency

"org.spring.core.tightCoupling" package demonstrates tight coupling
    - Car, Bike classes can be used by Traveller
    - But switching between the classes requires creation and injection manually

"org.spring.core.looseCouplingUsingInterface" package demonstrates loose coupling
    - Vehicle interface abstracts Car and Bike
    - Traveller uses this interface object, so no tight coupling
    - Main class needs to create object and pass to Traveller object

"org.spring.core.iocUsingJavaConfig" demonstrates Java Based Config for IOC Container
    - Create Configuration class and annotate with @Configuration
    - Methods returning objects are created and annotated with @Bean
    - The object to be injected is specified in the Configuration class
    - ApplicationContext container is created to retrieve Spring Beans
